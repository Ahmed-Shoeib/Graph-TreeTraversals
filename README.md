# Graph and Tree Traversals Visualization

This project is a C++ application built with **Qt** to visualize graph and tree traversal algorithms. It is designed as an educational tool to help students and developers understand the step-by-step execution of traversal algorithms through interactive visualizations.

## Features

* Graph traversal algorithms: **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) and **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
* Tree traversal algorithms: **Preorder**, **Inorder**, **Postorder**, and **Level-order**
* Interactive visualization of traversal steps
* User-friendly interface built with Qt
* Dynamic input for creating custom graphs and trees

## Tech Stack

* **C++** – Core application logic
* **Qt Framework** – GUI and visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-tree-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the application.

## Future Enhancements

* Add weighted graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal)
* Support for directed/undirected graph visualization
* Save and load graph/tree structures
* Improved animations for traversal steps

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or new features.
